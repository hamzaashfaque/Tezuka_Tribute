            <h1>Anime: How it all began</h1>
            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>
                Anime is simply just the japanese term for animation. Most people use the term to decribe specific type
                of animations with colorful 2D graphics.
            </p>

            <h2>Propaganda and other Early Animations</h2>
            <p>
                In 1917, Animators like Oten Shimokawa and Seitorou Kitayama started creating the first Japanese
                animations. However, some of these early animations and clips were destroyed in the 1923 due to an
                earthquake. In 1930s and 1940s Japan would start producing propaganda animations in support of Japanese
                government due to the ongoing World War II conflicts between Japan and it's enemies China and other
                fractured Chinese States, The Soviet Union and The United States. These animations were aimed mostly at
                Japanese children and were also sponsored by the Imperial Government.

                A good example is Momotaro no Umiwashi which was aired in 1943. Another one is Momotaro's Sacred Sailors
                which was aired in 1945. Both of these directed by Mitsuyo Seo and were Sponsored by the Imperial
                Japanese Navy.

            <h2>Osamu Tezuka</h2>
            <p>
                After the war in 1950s, many studios and animators would start adapting techniques of American
                animations to create their own cheaper mangas and animations like Otogi Manga Calander, Three Tales,
                Mole's Adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Osamu Tezuka also known as The Father of Manga, expeimented with and adapted many animation techniques
                used by American Animations. His efforts lead to the growing of animation industries in Japan due to new
                better quality and cost effective animation techniques. His works include Astro Boy, Kimba, Princess
                Knight, Pheonix, Black Jack, Dororo and many more. His works were influenced by Disney. He also met with
                Walt Disney personally in the 1964 New York World's Fair. Tezuka was also the descendant of the Ninja
                Hattori Hanzo who served Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu.
